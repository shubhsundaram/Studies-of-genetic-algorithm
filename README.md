# Studies-of-genetic-algorithm

The genetic Algorithm is inspired from the charles darwin thoery of natural selection.we are performing three studies here i.e. 1.) Unbound statistical behavior. 
2.) bound statistical behavior. 3.) bound statistical behavior with optimisation.
the minnimum value can be easily obtained but to get maximum value a ,'-'ve sign is added in front of the function so that it automatically give maxima value.

Explanation of the code:-

very first, clear command are used to clear everything from comman , editor and workspace.then defining search space and number cases equals to 50.then we used get_stalagmite function here.now, the first study is going to be cionducted using the for loop and tic-toc command is used to calculate the time taken by the software to run the program.
plot3 command is used with the help of marker,the label and titles are also added.

finally,the value of global maxima,global maxima x and y values and time taken for program evaluation are obtained in the command window as result including total time.
